# CarbonChain

**Turning Social Engagement into Climate Action**

## Overview
CarbonChain leverages social media engagement and blockchain technology to create a transparent, accessible, and engaging carbon credit platform. Users earn carbon credits by sharing their sustainability efforts online, which are then verified and tracked using advanced sentiment analysis and blockchain for transparency and accountability.

## Features
- **Social Media Integration:** Earn carbon credits by sharing your eco-friendly actions on social media.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Advanced AI verifies the authenticity of sustainability posts.
- **Blockchain Transparency:** Secure and transparent management of carbon credits using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Buy/Sell Carbon Credits:** Companies can trade carbon credits directly on our platform.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and engagement.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express.js, FastAPI
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, IPFS
- **ML Model:** PyTorch, BERT, OpenCV, Python
- **Deployment:** Polygon, Sepolia

## Architecture Design
1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users post about their sustainable actions on social media.
   - Users submit the post link on CarbonChainâ€™s platform.
   
2. **Data Processing:**
   - The link is processed using sentiment analysis (PyTorch, BERT).
   - Insights are generated and sent to the backend (Express.js, FastAPI).

3. **Blockchain Integration:**
   - Verified posts are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts (Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js).
   - Decentralized storage on IPFS ensures data integrity.

4. **Trading Platform:**
   - Companies can buy and sell carbon credits on the platform.
   - All transactions are transparent and secure.

## Challenges We Overcame
- **ML Model Integration:** Ensuring real-time processing and integration of sentiment analysis models.
- **Frontend-Backend Communication:** Establishing secure and reliable communication between the frontend and Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Smart Contract Integration:** Seamlessly integrating smart contracts with the frontend for smooth user interaction.

## Future Goals
- **Global Expansion:** Foster a diverse, global community of sustainability advocates.
- **Partnerships:** Collaborate with organizations to amplify our impact.
- **R&D Investment:** Enhance platform capabilities with cutting-edge technologies.
- **Policy Advocacy:** Support policy changes that incentivize carbon offset initiatives.
- **Empowerment:** Enable more individuals and organizations to lead in sustainability.
